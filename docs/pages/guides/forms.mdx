## Integration into forms

Pickers are quite complex controls, where date can be submitted
from different places, so we can't provide events as arguments in
an `onChange` callback. So you need to set up form field manually, based on the `onChange` param.

Also we are providing prop `onError` that is ready-to-use for validation. This callback fires once
the selected value by user is becomes invalid based on passed props (such like `minDate`, `minTime` or `shouldDisableDate`).
It returns you a reason why error was occured so it is possible to render custom error message.
